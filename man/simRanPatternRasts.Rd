\description{
A list of 100 simulated \code{SpatialExperiment} objects representing kidney-shaped
datasets, each containing one independently generated spatially patterned gene with
no correlation between datasets. Each dataset consists of \eqn{N = 5000} simulated
cells distributed within a kidney-shaped region, with spatial coordinates and
expression values generated from Gaussian random fields.
}
\details{
Each simulated dataset was generated as follows:
\itemize{
  \item Cell coordinates \eqn{(x, y)} were uniformly sampled within a bounding box
  from \eqn{x, y \in [0,1]}.
  \item A Matern covariance matrix \eqn{Cov_{ij}} of size \eqn{N \times N} was
  computed as:
  \deqn{
    Cov_{ij} = \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}
      \left(\frac{h \sqrt{2\nu}}{\kappa}\right)^{\nu}
      K_\nu \left(\frac{h \sqrt{2\nu}}{\kappa}\right)
  }
  where \eqn{h = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}}, \eqn{\nu = 0.5},
  \eqn{\kappa = 0.1}, \eqn{\Gamma} is the gamma function, and
  \eqn{K_\nu} is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.
  For diagonal elements (\eqn{i = j}), \eqn{Cov_{ij} = 1}.

  \item The covariance matrix was used to generate a multivariate normal vector
  \eqn{W_i} with mean 0 via \code{MASS::mvrnorm}.

  \item Independently and identically distributed noise \eqn{Z_i} was sampled using
  \code{stats::rnorm} with mean 0 and standard deviation \eqn{\sqrt{0.3}}.

  \item The simulated gene expression for each cell was computed as:
  \deqn{G_i = W_i + Z_i + 10}

  \item To form a kidney-shaped spatial pattern, each cell position was transformed
  to \eqn{(x, y) = (6x - 3, 6y - 3)} and retained only if its Euclidean distance from
  the origin satisfied:
  \deqn{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \le 1 - 2\sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta^2)}
  where \eqn{\theta = \mathrm{atan2}(y, x)}.
}

Each element of \code{simRanPatternRasts} is a \code{SpatialExperiment} object with:
\itemize{
  \item One simulated gene (1 row)
  \item 250–300 spatial pixels (columns)
  \item An assay named \code{"pixelval"} containing expression values
  \item \code{colData} with columns: \code{num_cell}, \code{cellID_list},
  \code{geometry}, and \code{sample_id}
  \item Spatial coordinates (\code{x}, \code{y})
}
