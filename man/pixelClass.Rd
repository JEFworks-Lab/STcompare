\title{Generates a spatial plot of pixel classifications for a given gene.}
\usage{
pixelClass(input, gene, assayName = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A list. Results from `spatialSimilarity()`. This includes the
similarity table, log-transformed pixel data, and analysis parameters.}

\item{gene}{Character. The name of the gene to visualize.}

\item{assayName}{A character string or numeric specifying the assay in the
Spatial Experiment to use. Default is \code{NULL}. If no value is supplied
for \code{assayName}, then the first assay is used as a default}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 spatial plot displaying classified pixels, where:
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{blue}}{Pixels classified as similar (within the fold-change threshold).}
  \item{\strong{yellow}}{Pixels with greater expression in dataset X than Y.}
  \item{\strong{red}}{Pixels with greater expression in dataset Y than X.}
  \item{\strong{grey}}{Pixels with gene expression below the threshold in both experiments.}
}
  The plot is generated using `sf` (simple features) for spatial
  representation and is overlaid with pixel classifications. The plot title
  includes the gene name and its similarity score.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the spatial distribution of gene expression
similarity by classifying pixels into three categories: below threshold,
similar, and not similar. The plot is generated using spatial geometry from
the SpatialExperiment object.
